#  Architectural Review & Strategy Proposal

## System Design & Scalability Critique

Looking at what I built, there are several obvious issues that would cause problems in production. The current system makes individual HTTP requests without any rate limiting, which is problematic since Binance has a 1200 requests/minute limit and OKX has 20 requests/second - we'd hit these limits fast. There's no intelligent request batching or caching, and if we hit rate limits, the whole system just fails. All requests are synchronous HTTP calls, so if an exchange is slow, everything blocks. There's no connection pooling or keep-alive, and the single-threaded async model means one slow request blocks others. If Binance goes down, we lose all Binance data with no fallback mechanism.

The system has significant memory and performance issues. L2 order books can be huge with 1000+ levels, and storing full snapshots every second eats memory quickly. There's no data compression or streaming, and all data is kept in memory until batch write, which could lose data on crash. There's no backpressure handling for slow consumers. The state management has problems with no persistent state - if the app crashes, we lose all order tracking. Position monitoring relies on order IDs that might not persist, and there are no transaction-like guarantees for order placement.

The storage implementation has critical issues. Task 5 currently uses mock S3 storage with data saved locally to `./data/s3_mock/` instead of actual AWS S3. The `S3ParquetStorage` class has a `mock_mode=True` default parameter. While this works for demos, it's not production-ready storage. There are no actual S3 credentials or bucket configuration in production, and local file storage could fill up disk space quickly in real usage.

To make this production-ready, I'd need to completely redesign it with a message queue architecture. The ideal setup would use WebSockets instead of REST for real-time data to achieve lower latency and less rate limiting. Kafka would handle buffering and backpressure, with separate services for market data, trading, and position monitoring that can scale independently. For caching and performance, Redis would cache exchange data with 5-10 second TTL, implement in-memory order books with periodic snapshots, use connection pooling with aiohttp/asyncio, and add circuit breakers for failing exchanges.

High availability would require multiple instances of each service, load balancers for API endpoints, database replication with PostgreSQL for orders and TimescaleDB for time series, and health checks with auto-restart. The data pipeline would use Apache Kafka for streaming data, Apache Flink for real-time processing, S3 for cold storage, TimescaleDB for hot data, and data partitioning by exchange/pair/date. The storage infrastructure would replace mock S3 with actual AWS S3 with proper IAM roles, implement S3 lifecycle policies for data retention, add CloudWatch monitoring for storage metrics, use S3 Transfer Acceleration for better upload performance, and implement proper error handling for S3 upload failures.

The error handling I implemented is pretty basic with just try/catch blocks and some retries. In production this would be a disaster. If an exchange API is down, we just log an error and continue with no circuit breaker pattern, no fallback to cached data, and no alerting when exchanges fail. There's no timeout handling for slow connections, no connection pooling, no retry with exponential backoff, and no health checks. Data consistency is poor with no transaction guarantees for order placement - if we crash between placing order and updating state, we lose track, and there's no idempotency for retries.

A robust error handling strategy would implement a circuit breaker pattern that tracks failure counts and automatically opens the circuit after a threshold of failures, with a recovery timeout before attempting to close it again. Graceful degradation would use cached data when an exchange is down, implement fallback exchanges for critical pairs, show warnings in UI but don't crash the system, and queue orders for later execution when exchange is back. State recovery would store all orders in persistent database, use event sourcing pattern for order state changes, implement idempotency keys for all API calls, and regular state reconciliation with exchanges.

Monitoring and alerting would include Prometheus metrics for all API calls, Grafana dashboards for system health, PagerDuty alerts for exchange failures, and structured logging with correlation IDs. WebSocket connection management would maintain persistent connections with automatic reconnection logic and exponential backoff delays. Data consistency would use database transactions for order placement, implement two-phase commit for cross-exchange orders, regular reconciliation jobs to catch inconsistencies, and event sourcing for audit trail.

The current implementation is a good prototype but would need significant architectural changes for production use. The main challenges are handling scale, reliability, and maintaining consistency across multiple exchanges with different APIs and failure modes. The mock storage approach is actually pretty smart for development - it lets you test the exact same code path that would be used in production, just with local storage instead of S3. The `S3ParquetStorage` class defaults to `mock_mode=True`, so instead of uploading to AWS S3, it saves Parquet files locally to `./data/s3_mock/` using the same Parquet format and data structure as real S3 would. This means no AWS costs during development/testing, no S3 credentials needed for local development, same data format as production would use, and easy to switch to real S3 by setting `mock_mode=False` and providing AWS credentials. But it's definitely something that needs to be called out and addressed for production deployment.
